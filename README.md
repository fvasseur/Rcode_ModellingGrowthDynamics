# Rcode_ModellingGrowthDynamics
This R code is used to model growth dynamics in A.thaliana, including rosette DM, absolute and relative growth rate. 
It uses nls to fit a sigmoid growth curve on rosette DM data collected during ontogeny, and allows calculating growth variables at any time point between germination and reproduction.
